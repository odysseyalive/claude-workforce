# ui-design reference version

This file is the **drift anchor** for the ui catalog, mirroring the code, text and security
catalogs. An audit reads the integer below (workforce's *shipped* ui-reference version) and
compares it to the version recorded in a project's `ui-design` skill. Shipped > recorded → the
project's references are stale → the refresh updates the workforce-owned (`modifiable: true`)
reference blocks, preserving any `origin: user` seams.

```
ui-design-ref-version: 1
```

**v1** (2026-09-10) — the built catalog: `design-quality-catalog.md`, ~55 cited rules with stable IDs
(VH/COL/TYP/IMG/CTA/A11Y/SLOP/CRIT/MSG/BF) each carrying a severity, a Basis tag and a fetched source,
plus the hard-fail RED FLAGS gate and the Source Ledger; and `rendered-checks.md`, the
declared-vs-rendered enumeration and the reflow category (RC-01..RC-06) the rule catalog does not cover.

*This replaced a single seed spec, `ui-design-seed.md`, on the day the evaluators began shipping as
skills. The seed stated the same concerns in prose and carried NO rule IDs, so nothing an evaluator
reported could be keyed to a citable rule and nothing a project overrode could be named in a
supersession register. The catalog here is the one real projects were already grading against; what
changed is that it ships, resolvable from the install, instead of being copied into a project once and
tracked by nothing.*

*Why this file exists at all: a catalog with no anchor cannot be reported stale, and two of the nine
text-catalog copies measured on 2026-09-10 carried no anchor — a state that renders as "unknown"
rather than as a version, which is precisely the drift nobody can act on.*
